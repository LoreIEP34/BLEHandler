 *  @brief BLEHandler is a class that simplifies the creation and management of BLE services and characteristics.
 *  It provides methods to initialize the BLE server, add services and characteristics, start advertising,
 *  and send notifications to connected clients.
 * 
 *  @version 0.1
 *  @date 2025-06-23
 *  @note This class is designed to be used with the NimBLE library for ESP32.
